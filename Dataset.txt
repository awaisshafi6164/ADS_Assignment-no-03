Project Title: Predicting Housing Prices

Project Description:
In this data science project, we will work on predicting housing prices based on various features. The dataset used for this project contains information about different houses, including their size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, and other relevant attributes.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features. By analyzing historical housing data, we aim to identify the patterns and relationships between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (housing price).

The dataset consists of the following features:

1. Size: The total area of the house in square feet.
2. Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
3. Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.
4. Location: The geographical location of the house.
5. Age: The age of the house in years.
6. Garage: The number of garage spaces available.
7. Condition: The overall condition of the house on a scale of 1 to 10.
8. Neighborhood: The type of neighborhood where the house is located.
9. Schools: The proximity of schools to the house.
10. Transportation: The availability of public transportation in the area.

The target variable in this project is the price of the house. We will explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and preprocess the features to ensure they are suitable for modeling. We will then split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our predictive model.

For modeling, we will employ regression techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests, depending on the complexity of the dataset. We will train the model using the training set and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).

Once the model is developed and validated, it can be used to predict the price of a new house based on its features. This information can be valuable for real estate agents, homeowners, or potential buyers who are interested in estimating the market value of a property.

Overall, this project aims to demonstrate the application of data science techniques in predicting housing prices, providing valuable insights into the factors that influence house prices and enabling informed decision-making in the real estate market.
